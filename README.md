With smart sensing as our theme and track, and with technological innovation, this product promotes human connections by proactively reducing health complications throuh cientific data analysis. When everyone is at their best form, they are empowered to do their best work and that is all we are about. 

This work has 3 main components
Genral usecase
1. Our FormFit modular wearable hardware
2. A mobile App for our users(everyday users, UPS drivers,general fitness)


Users can capture EEG signals from their muscles and body throuth the wearables and that data is streamed to the mobile app to help improve their health during and after their activities as well as provide data analytics.   

With all that data being collected and analyzed, it provides another usecase to even push the boundaries of our species as humana and connects us more using spatial technologies.
